KM GPT is a small wrapper for the ChatGPT API and a keyboard maestro activation script.

1. Install requirements in a virtualenv
2. Install KM macro
3. If needed modify KM Macro so that this line:

						<string>~/code/kmgpt/run.sh</string>
            
   Works for your installation

When you use the hotkey (cmd-shift-C by default) you get a menu of choices, tied to pre-canned prompts, see src/gen.py
